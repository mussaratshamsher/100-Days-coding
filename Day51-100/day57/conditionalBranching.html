<title2> Conditional operator ‘?’ </title2>
// The operator is represented by a question mark ?. Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. 
let result= condition? vlaue1 : vlaue2;

// Multiple?

<title3> Non-traditional use of '?' </title3>
//Sometimes the question mark ? is used as a replacement for if:
let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '')
(company == 'Netscape') ?
alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
//If-else statement
if (company == 'Netscape') {
  alert('Right!');
} else {
