            //unary operator: An operator is unary if it has a single operand
//negation: reverses the sign of the number
let x = 1;
x = -x;
alert(x);
//binary operator: An operator is binary if it has two operands.
let y = 1;
let z = 4;
alert(z-y)
//Maths operations:
//Addition +
//Subtraction -
//Multiplication *
// Division /
// Remainder %
// Exponentiation **

//Remainder %
alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3

//Exponentiation **
alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 2² = 4
alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 2³ = 8

//String concatenation with binary +
//The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way.
//number defined using string will be combined with the number

let s = "my" + "string";
alert('1' + 2); //12
alert(2+ '1'); //21
alert('1'+ 2+2) //14
alert(2+2 + '1') //41

//Subtraction & division are performed same as without quotes
alert(6 - '2');
alert('6' -2);
//Numeric conversion, unary +
// The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

// The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. 
// But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
//No effect on nembers
let a = 1;
alert( +a);
let b = -2;
alert( +b);
//converts non-numbers
alert( +true); //1
alert( +"");  //0

//The binary plus would add numbers as strings:
let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";
alert(apples + oranges); //23
//If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:
alert( +apples + +oranges); //5

//Assignment operatpr: an assignment = is also an operator. 
let xy = 2 * 2 + 1;
alert(xy); //5

//Assignment = returns a value:All operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for + and -, but also true for =.
let ab = 1; bc = 2; 
let abc = 3 (ab = bc + 1);
alert(ab); //3
alert(bc) ; //0
//Chaining assignments : Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:
let g, h, i;
g = h = i = 2 + 2;
alert(g);  //4
alert(h);  //4
alert(i);  //4

//Modify-in-place
//let n = 2; n = n + 5; n = n * 2;
//This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:

let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)
alert( n ); // 14
let m = 2;

m *= 3 + 5; // right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8

alert( m ); // 16
//Increment/ decrement: Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.
//Increment ++ increases a variable by 1:

let counter = 2;
counter++;        // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 3
//Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:

let counter1 = 2;
counter1--;        // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
alert( counter1 ); // 1

//Increment/decrement among other operators
let counter3 = 1;
alert( 2 * ++3 ); //4
//Bitwise operators
// These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.
// The list of operators:

// 1. AND ( & )
// 2. OR ( | )
// 3. XOR ( ^ )
// 4. NOT ( ~ )
// 5. LEFT SHIFT ( << )
// 6. RIGHT SHIFT ( >> )
// 7. ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( >>> )

// Commma: The comma operator , is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. 
let d = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
alert( d ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
