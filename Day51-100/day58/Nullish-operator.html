//The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.
// The result of a ?? b is:
// if a is defined, then a,
// if a isn’t defined, then b.
// In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.
let user;
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); //Anonymous as user is undefined
let user1 = "John";
alert(user ?? "Anonymous");//john as user is not null/undefined

let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "SuperCoder";
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous")

//Comparison with ||
// The important difference between them is that:
// || returns the first truthy value.
// ?? returns the first defined value.
// In other words, || doesn’t distinguish between false, 0, an empty string "" and null/undefined. They are all the same – falsy values. 
// If any of these is the first argument of ||, then we’ll get the second argument as the result.
let height = 0;
alert(height || 100); //100
alert(height ?? 100); //0
