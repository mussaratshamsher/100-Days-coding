// The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. 
// It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, alert.

//Continue to the next iteration
// The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn’t stop the whole loop. Instead,
//  it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).
